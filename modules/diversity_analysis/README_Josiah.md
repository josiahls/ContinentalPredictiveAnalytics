<h1>
Diversity Module
</h1>

<h3>
Goal
</h3>
<p>
Generate predictions based on diversity.
</p>

<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
I didn't include the age dates. 
Should we include those?
There are a lot of correlated data.
Gender is labeled weirdly.

We have age, gender, ethnicity

We are missing:
More detailed Race (ethnicity seemed hispanic mostly)
Missing country of origin (or all of them are from Canada???)
Missing disability
Missing Education
</p>
